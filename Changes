Revision history for MongoDBx-Queue

{{$NEXT}}

    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    - MongoDBx::Queue prior to version 1.000 were not fork-safe.  A fork
      could cause MongoDB connections to hang.  As of 1.000, MongoDB
      connections are managed via MooseX::Role::MongoDB, which provides
      fork-safety.

    - As result of this change, attributes have changed.  MongoDBx::Queue
      no longer has a C<db> attributed taking a MongoDB::Database argument
      and the C<name> attribute has been renamed to C<collection_name>

    - Now, you provide C<client_options> controlling the connection to
      the database.  You provide C<database_name> to indicate the database
      to hold your queue.  And you provide C<collection_name> to indicate
      the collection to hold the queue.

    - No attributes are required any more.  By default, MongoDBx::Queue
      will connect to localhost on the default MongoDB port, will use
      the 'test' database and the 'queue' collection.

    [FIXES]

    - Fixed task reservation on Perl v5.18 that borke due to hash-order
      randomization. MongoDB expects command documents to be ordered a
      certain way so we now use array references instead of hash references
      to pass such commands.

    [INTERNAL]

    - Dropped Const::Fast as prerequisite

    [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

    - reschedule_task() now takes a hashref of options using the same format
        as add_task() instead of taking a scalar epoch seconds time argument

    [ADDED]

    - add_task() now supports setting arbitrary priority

    [CHANGED]

    - reserve_task() only find tasks up to a maximum priority; defaults to
        time(); this makes "future" tasks invisible unless a different
        maximum priority is requested

    - generally improved documentation for consistency describing new
        features
