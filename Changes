  [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

  - reschedule_task() now takes a hashref of options using the same format
    as add_task() instead of taking a scalar epoch seconds time argument
  
  [ADDED]

  - add_task() now supports setting arbitrary priority

  [CHANGED]

  - reserve_task() only find tasks up to a maximum priority; defaults to
    time(); this makes "future" tasks invisible unless a different
    maximum priority is requested

  - generally improved documentation for consistency describing new
    features
